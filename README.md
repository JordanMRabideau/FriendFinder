# FriendFinder

## Purpose
The purpose of the friend finder app is to match the user with a new friend based on the user's answers to a set of questions.

## Overview
Friend finder takes the user's answers to a series of questions and compares them to the answers of previous users. The previous user who's answers most closely match that of the current user is then shown to the current user. The current user is then added to to an array of 'friends' so that the next user may match with them.
